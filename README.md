For CODTECH Internship Task-1, we implemented a file handling program in the C programming language to demonstrate basic operations such as creating a file, writing data to it, appending additional content, and reading the file’s contents. Due to limitations in the Programiz Online C Compiler—which restricts actual file read/write operations—we simulated file handling using in-memory strings and displayed the expected output using printf() statements. This approach allowed us to visualize the process without relying on actual file system access. The task helped in understanding the core concepts of file handling in C, including how data can be managed beyond runtime memory. In real-world scenarios, such knowledge is essential for applications like log systems, data storage, and file-based communication between programs. The skills gained through this task form a foundation for working with databases, data serialization, and building software that interacts with the operating system.
